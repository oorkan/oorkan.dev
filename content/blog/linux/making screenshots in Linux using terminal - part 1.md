**Using the `xwd` command**

If our Linux OS is using the {{<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}X Window System{{</a>}}, we can use the `xwd` command there to make screenshots. This command is part of a package called `x11-apps`. Under Debian-based operating systems, like Ubuntu, we can run `sudo apt install x11-apps` to install it. 

```bash

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -out screenshot.xwd

```

The command above will provide us a pointer to select the window we want to make a screenshot of. The problem here is that when we have another window in the foreground, that window will be captured as well as shown in the illustration.

To avoid this, we can use the `sleep` command and have a delay before taking the screenshot to successfully minimize, close, or bring backward all other windows we don't want to capture.

```bash

ðŸš€ ~ sleep 5; xwd -out screenshot.xwd

```

The `xwd` command uses its own format for screenshots. We can convert `.xwd` to standard image formats by using a visual editor, like {{<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}GIMP{{</a>}}, or command-line tools, like the `convert` from {{<a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}ImageMagick{{</a>}}.

```bash

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -out screenshot.xwd
ðŸš€ ~ convert screenshot.xwd screenshot.jpg

```

By default, `xwd` will not include the window frame. To make it shown, we must use the `frame` flag, like this: 

```bash

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -frame -out screenshot.xwd

```

And, finally, to make a screenshot of the entire screen with all windows, we should use the `root` flag. All frames of all windows will be included in this case. There's no need to specify the `frame` flag when using it with the `root` flag.

```bash

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -root -out screenshot.xwd

```

Itâ€™s important to mention that the `xwd` command doesn't talk well or, sometimes, even allow window background transparency options. Keep this in mind when taking your screenshots with it. ðŸ™‚
