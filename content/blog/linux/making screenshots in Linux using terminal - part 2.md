In the {{<a href="">}}previous part{{</a>}} we saw how to make screenshots in terminal using the `xwd` command. In this part we'll meet the `import` command.

Go to part 1.


**Using the `xwd` command**

If our Linux OS is using the {{<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/7/x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}X Window System{{</a>}}, we can use the `xwd` (X window dump) command there to make screenshots. This command is part of a package called `x11-apps`. Under Debian-based operating systems {{<a href="https://distrowatch.com/search.php?basedon=Debian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}ðŸ”—{{</a>}}, like Ubuntu, we can run `sudo apt install x11-apps` to install it. 

{{< highlight bash >}}

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -out screenshot.xwd

{{< / highlight >}}

The command above will provide us a pointer to select the window we want to make a screenshot of. The problem here is that when we have another window in the foreground, that window will be captured as well, as shown in the illustration.

To avoid this, we can use the `sleep` command and have a delay before taking a screenshot to successfully minimize, close, or bring backward all other windows we don't want to capture.

{{< highlight bash >}}

ðŸš€ ~ sleep 5; xwd -out screenshot.xwd

{{< / highlight >}}

The `xwd` command uses its own format for screenshots. We can convert `.xwd` to standard image formats by using a visual editor, like {{<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}GIMP{{</a>}}, or command-line tools, like the `convert` from {{<a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}ImageMagick{{</a>}}.

{{< highlight bash >}}

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -out screenshot.xwd
ðŸš€ ~ convert screenshot.xwd screenshot.jpg

{{< / highlight >}}

By default, `xwd` will not include the window frame. To make it shown, we must use the `frame` flag, like this: 

{{< highlight bash >}}

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -frame -out screenshot.xwd

{{< / highlight >}}

And, finally, to make a screenshot of the entire screen with all windows, we should use the `root` flag. All frames of all windows will be included in this case. There's no need to specify the `frame` flag when using the command with the `root` flag.

{{< highlight bash >}}

ðŸš€ ~ xwd -root -out screenshot.xwd

{{< / highlight >}}

Itâ€™s important to mention that the `xwd` command doesn't talk well or, sometimes, even allow window background transparency options. Keep this in mind when taking your screenshots with it. ðŸ™‚
