**1. alias**

This command will define or display aliases of commands. When typed without any argument, the `alias` command will display all aliases that are defined in the shell in the `name=value` format.

To define alias, we do:

```bash
	alias foo=bar
```

**2. clear**

This is a very common command and clears your bash output. The same thing is available via `Ctrl+L` in almost any linux distro.

**3. dirs**
pushd, popd

To be continued...

**4. cpio**

**5. tail**
