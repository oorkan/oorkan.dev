Sometimes, we want to share with others a small piece of code. Or, we need to store somewhere a codeblock to review later. Opening a Github repository for just one file doesn't sound reasonable. I discovered Github Gists few months ago while it was officially available {{<a href="https://gist.github.com/schacon/1#file-gistfile1-txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}since 2008{{</a>}}.

**What's a Gist**

As GitHub states: "every Gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned". Being a Git repository also means that we can push to a Gist or pull from it. Like Git repositories, Gists can be public or private but privacy here is very different from repository privacy. Unlike repositories, when creating a private Gist, it still can be available to others if they have or discover the Gist url. It means that storing a sensitive information in Github Gist is not the best idea. This is why, unlike repositories, Gists aren't called private but **secret**. 

Another important information is that when we create a gist, later we can't change it from public to secret and vice versa. Instead, if we want to change, let's say, a public Gist to a secret Gist, we must delete the old one and create a new one, this time changing it's visibility.

**Creating a Gist**

To create a gist, we simply go to {{<a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}gist.github.com{{</a>}}. There we add a Gist description, name our file (including the file extension) and add content to it.

Single Gist can contain multiple files. To add more than one file to a gist, we click on "Add File" button.

To receive notifications when some Gist changes, we can "Follow" it.

To see all your gists you simply go to {{<a href="gist.github.com/oorkan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}gist.github.com/<username>{{</a>}}, like {{<a href="gist.github.com/oorkan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">}}gist.github.com/oorkan{{</a>}}.

Gists can be useful in many situations and serve you and your team. They can also save a lot of time for you because their creation and setup is way more faster than a regular repository, just one url away from you.
