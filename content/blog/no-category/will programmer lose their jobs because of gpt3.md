<!-- My thoughts on AI, ML and GPT3 -->

I heard about GPT3 few days ago via post in Twitter shared by {{<a href="https://twitter.com/_ericelliott" target="_blank">}}Eric Eliott{{</a>}} - well-known professional in the JavaScript world. 

Being honest, I never did anything related to AI or ML, literally nothing, not even a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù thing. So if you want to hear something objective and technical, then this post is not the right place to look at. I decided to write this post just to share my thought about GPT3 and Artificial Intelligence, in general. {{<a href="https://youtu.be/8psgEDhT1MM?t=74" target="_blank">}}GPT3 demos{{</a>}} made a lot of boom in the tech world, and now everyone (including me.. üò≥) tries to jump into that "hype train".&nbsp;Although, I feel shame for saying this but here's a good chance to share my thought on this topic when it's on the peak because these technologies are very interesting to me. Ah yeah, forgot to say, when using the word "hype", I didn't mean the technology itself but the noise that accumulates around it right now.

**The Fear**

I hear some concern around devs, like "ahh.. this is the end of programming", "we‚Äôll lose our jobs", and even "should I continue learning React" and so on. The question, overall, is: "Will programmers lose their jobs because of GPT3?". To answer this question we must first understand where this fear comes from. At first look, it's banal: people afraid to be replaced by a software which will handle the same job. But there are deeper levels, like the fear from the dominance of General Intelligence, etc, which can come from science fiction, apocalyptic movies, and, of course, Elon Mask's public speeches by the time ü§´ üòÅ.

**So, Will Programmers Lose Their Jobs Because of AI?**

Short answer: *No*.

Long answer: *Yes, of course...*

What a dilemma ü§î

**Why No**

You‚Äôll not lose your jobs. The technology is still in its embryo. It has a lot of time to grow and adapt in the market. In addition to this, right now it's too expensive to replace people doing the same thing.

**Why Yes, More Strictly**

**Reason No. 1 - Abstraction**

If you do programming for years, you should realize by now that everything in programming is about abstration and automation. All our work, in general, serves to one purpose: abstract away the hard parts and build easy-to-understand interfaces on top of that abstractions. We don't write code in Assembly anymore (at least, most of us). Instead, we invented languages that compile to it to be more productive.

You should ask yourself this question: *What's the most abstract language in our known nature?* 

The one we use to speak, right? We haven't invented anything easier, yet. So, whenever we are closer to explain to the machine like we used to explain to another human, the productivity grows because we spend less resources for abstracting away more layers to do the same job.

**Reason No. 2 - Economics**

Those of us who know even a school-level economics must understand that automation is cheaper. Whenever business has a chance to replace the worker by a software or a robot doing the same thing with cheaper price, it surely will. *Less costs in production produce higher income for the final product*. Yeah, I'm cheating here a little because right now Machine Learning and AI-based techs are very expensive. But that's not going to last for long. Like smartphones, this tech will decrease in price during the time.

**Reason No. 3 - Progress**

It's a topic for philosophical debate what the progress means. But since we don't have time for that, let's assume that humanity is constantly progressing from the start of its history. In this prisme, the world is moving towards the tendence to make our lifes easier. Now, programming languages evolved since the last century and the way we are writing software now is way more easier than people were doing in 70's, for example. But the constant improvement of programming languages can't be limitless. The goal is to provide us human-interactable interface where we can talk with the machine in plain English, that's the most productive programming language I think.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

If we summarize the points above and think about it, then it's clear, that the programming, as we understand it right now, will transform dramatically. And for most of us, these changes will cut the salary and our jobs. This will happen because clients / businesses will not need to hold a programmer as a 3rd party between their business logic and software. It's important to mention, that I don't mean the whole field but just a very big part of it, like Web Programming, DevOps, and so on, for example. You get the idea.

**What areas will be affected first?**

It's risky prediction but I think the first wave of changes will beat the Frontend Development. Yeah, we have examples when the code produced by automation is junky, maybe doesn't have the best structure for human-driven maintenance, etc but we are talking about machines, they will handle all that stuff. 

**When will this happen?**

You know, we, programmers, always lack to give estimates so it‚Äôs very hard to predict. But technology grows very fast, especially, technology with millions of dollars invested in. I‚Äôll take the risk and say that this will happen sometime soon. Maybe soon will be 10, or even more years from now but 10 years is nothing if you think about it in perspective.

**What should I do? A positive note.**

Less programming jobs doesn't mean less jobs at all. I think there will be a need to test the software produced by a machine and that's a place where human will be irreplaceable for a long time. This includes testing, quality assurance, logical analysis and many other things. 

I think we should invest our time learning stuff that has a room for creativity and gives us ability to create something new, express ourselves better and so on. I also think that we should invest ourselves more into fundamental sciences, social interactions, philosophy, art... and everything else we are here for. If we can do that by programming, if we can build new and interesting things with it, then let's do it. Humans are very good at expression and not at routine, let's keep the routine for machines and fill our lives with more meaning.

Hope you enjoyed.
